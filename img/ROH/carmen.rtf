\f0\b\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 carmen @ royal opera house\

\b0\fs24 a YCN Student Design brief asking for a rebrand for the Royal Opera House, with the aim of engaging under 30\'92s with opera. I looked specially at the performance Carmen, one of ROH\'92s most popular, incorporating its infamous score by Georges Bizet with the online branding, to create short animations and gifs that are auditory and visually striking, able to penetrate the desired target audience within the social media sphere. }
